const engdesc = "This test attempts to use a set of questions to assess whether the user is left or right wing, and to what extent. Unlike most other tests, this tries to refer to the general ideas of being left or right rather than focusing on more specific issues, which in reality cannot always be fit as nicely on this spectrum as many may believe, and many movements considered left or right are often the opposite. It therefore is possible that your result will be different to your expectations. The left can be defined as wanting to minimise social hierarchy, whereas the right can be defined as wanting to keep or increase it. Seeing these definitions alone, it can be seen that the left is generally libertarian and the right authoritarian, almost by definition. The right will also in order to protect power oppose progressive movements trying to reduce authority, and the left will support them.</br></br>This test will give you a score between 0 and 1 (0 being centre, 1 being far left or right) and a picture showing the result on a chart. If you do not understand any of the terms, please look them up, as putting Neutral or skipping a question will still have an impact on the final score.
